                <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. 
                    Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty,
                     in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb 
                     (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone,
                      Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</i></p><br><br>
                      
                      <h4 class="p01" style="font-size: 30px;"  >tombs</h4><br><br>
                    
                 
                      <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a sizable, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Indo-Islamic in origin.[22]

                     The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure
                         that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly 
                         shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical
                          on all sides of the building.</i></p><br>
                          <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i> Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi
                           of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.</i></p><br>

                           <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i>The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high
                             which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because 
                             of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome).[24] The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height. </i></p><br>
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i>The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The dome is slightly 
                             asymmetrical.[25] Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls,
                              and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which 
                              mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.</i></p><br>

                              <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i>The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. This feature provides a clear example of integration
                             of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[27] The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.</i></p><br>
                            
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(5, 5, 5);"><i></i>The 40 metres (130 ft) minarets were used by the muezzin to call the believers to prayer
                            The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets – a traditional element 
                            of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower.
                             At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus 
                             design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions 
                             of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.[29]</i></p><br><br>
