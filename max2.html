    <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(10, 10, 10);"><i>The history of Mexican pyramids dates back to the pre-Columbian era, a time before the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. 
        The earliest pyramids were built by the Olmec culture around 1200 BC, but the most famous pyramids were constructed by the Maya and the Aztec civilizations.<br>

        The Maya civilization existed from 2000 BC to 1500 AD and was located in the present-day regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The Maya built hundreds of pyramids, 
        and their largest and most famous pyramid is the Pyramid of the Sun, located in Teotihuacan, Mexico.<br>
        
        </i></p><br><br>
                     <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(10, 10, 10);"><i>The Aztec civilization, on the other hand, existed from the 14th to the 16th century AD and was located in central Mexico.
                         The Aztecs built many pyramids, but the most famous is the Temple Mayor, located in the center of their capital, Tenochtitlan, which is now Mexico City.<br>

                        Mexican pyramids were constructed using various materials, including stone, mud bricks, and adobe. The construction process was highly complex and involved the use of advanced
                         mathematical and engineering skills.<br>
                        
                        The pyramids were built in stages, with each stage representing a different level of religious or cultural significance. The base of the pyramid was the largest and the
                         most important, representing the earth and the physical world. The top of the pyramid was the smallest and represented the heavens and the spiritual world.<br>
                        
                        The pyramids were often decorated with elaborate carvings and murals, depicting religious and cultural scenes. They were also used for various religious and cultural ceremonies, 
                        including human sacrifice, which was practiced by some of the ancient Mexican cultures.<br>
