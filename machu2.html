    <p  class="p2" style="color: white;"><i>Machu Picchu is the most well-known historic site in all of Peru—maybe even in all of South America.
         It’s also on many globetrotters’ bucket list travel destinations. But how much do we really know about the site? We are here to shine some
          light on the mystery and intrigue surrounding Peru’s greatest archaeological treasureMachu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology 
        at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s.[22] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS)
         to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD.[23][24] Construction appears to date from 
         two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493)</i></p><br><br>
        
              <p  class="p2" style="color: white;"><i>A consensus among archaeologists is that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the
                 royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered 
                 to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before 
                 being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[22] It is possible that most
                  of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors even arrived in the area.</i></p><br><br>
        

                  <h2 class="p02">Ancient life</h2><br><br>
                  <p class="p2"  style="color: white;"><i>During its use as an estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived there,
                     with most serving as support staff (yanaconas, yana)[28][page needed][29] who lived there permanently. Though the estate
                      belonged to Pachacutec, religious specialists and temporary specialized workers (mayocs) lived there as well, most likely 
                      for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the harsher season, staffing was reduced to about one hundred servants 
                      and a few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone</i></p><br><br>

                  <p class="p2"  style="color: white;"><i>Studies show that, according to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were 
                    immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been 
                    living there their entire lives. Instead, research into skeletal remains has found bone damage from various species of water
                     parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities 
                     suggesting varying long-term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart.[30] These diets are composed of 
                     varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the last-known short-term diet for these people was overall
                      composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu
                       Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake.[29] Most skeletal remains found at the site had lower levels of arthritis
                        and bone fractures than those found in most sites of the Inca Empire.</i></p><br><br>
