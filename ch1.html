    <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(241, 236, 236);"><i>In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue's completion, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of Rio,
         consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron saint—Our Lady of the Apparition—under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.<br>

        Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state
         government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again
          on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.

                     <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(243, 239, 239);"><i>In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and
                         soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation,
                          spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act "a crime against the nation". The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.<br>

                        In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo's usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced 
                        the statue while in an Inter Milan strip.[23] The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church.<br>

                        <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(243, 241, 241);"><i>In 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo,
                             oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator of IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de 
                             Janeiro entered into an agreement to conduct restoration work.</i></p><br><br>
               
                             <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(238, 231, 231);"><i>More work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators,
                                 walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010[25] focused on the
                                  statue itself. The statue's internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms
                                   and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue's head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.</i></p><br><br>


                             <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(231, 229, 229);"><i>The restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue.
                                During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<br>

                                Maintenance work needs to be conducted periodically because of the strong winds and erosion to which the statue is exposed, as well as lightning strikes.The original pale stone is no
                                 longer available in sufficient quantity, and replacement stones are increasingly darker in hue.</i></p><br><br>
