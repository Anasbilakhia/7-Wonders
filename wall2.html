    <p  class="p2" style="color: white;"><i>The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring
         and Autumn (771–476 BC)[1] and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions
          by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.Later dynasties adopted different
           policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115–1234), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt,
            re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls,
             while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1912) mostly did not build
              frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.</i></p><br><br>
        
              <p  class="p2" style="color: white;"><i>Although a useful deterrent against raids, at several points throughout its history the Great Wall failed 
                to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Qing troops marched through the gates of the Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China proper.
                The Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain.[2] Some sections
                 remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons,[3] deconstructed for their building materials,[3] or lost due to the 
                 ravages of time.[4] For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.he conflict between the Chinese and the nomads, from 
                  which the need for the Great Wall arose, stemmed from differences in geography. The 15" isohyet marks the extent of settled agriculture, dividing the fertile fields of China to the south and the semi-arid
                   grasslands of Inner Asia to the north.[6] The climates and the topography of the two regions led to distinct modes of societal development.<br><br>

                 According to the model by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it possible for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into
                  the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley,[8] such extensive waterworks on an ever-increasing scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy.[9] Thus 
                  the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore to keep track of the income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept 
                  invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within.[10] These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped
                   cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.<br><br>
                 
                 The steppe societies of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood in stark contrast to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to
                  be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads. According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model.[11] As the steppe population grew, 
                  pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, 
                  and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the nomads would resort to raiding or even conques</i></p><br><br>
