    <h2 class="p02">INTRODUCATION</h2><br><br>
    <p class="p2"><i>Petra is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit<br>
         system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstonefrom which it is carved;[6] it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old as time" <br> 
         in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running <br> 
         from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[7] Access to the city is through a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long gorge called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.</i></p>
            <p  class="p2"><i>The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[8] and the Nabataeans might have settled in what<br>
                 would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the<br>
                  second century BC,[10] by which time Petra had become their capital.[8] The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by<br>
                   establishing it as a major regional trading hub.<br>

                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in<br>
                 the barren deserts and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture,<br>
                  and stone carving. Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population<br>
                   peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[12] They developed a complex system of cisterns, channels, and dams to collect and store rainwater, allowing them to thrive in the<br>
                    arid desert environment. Most of the famous rock-cut buildings, which are mainly tombs, date from this and the following period. Much less remains of the free-standing buildings of the city.</i></p><br><br>
            <p  class="p2"><i>Although the Nabataean kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106<br>
                 AD that it lost its independence. Petra fell to the Romans, who annexed Nabataea and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[13] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged,<br>
                  and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic<br>
                   era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it</i></p><br><br>
            <p  style="margin-left:3%;color:rgb(8, 8, 8); text-align: center;text-align: left;font-size: 18px;"><i>It has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural<br>
                 properties of man's cultural heritage".[15] In 2007, Petra was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[16] Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist<br>
                  attraction. Tourist numbers peaked at 1.1 million in 2019, marking the first time that the figure rose above the 1 million mark.[17] Tourism in the historical city was hit hard by<br>
                   the COVID-19 pandemic, but soon after started to pick up again, reaching 905,000 visitors in 2022</i></p><br><br>
