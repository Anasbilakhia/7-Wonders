<p   class="p2"><i><h4>Neolithic</h4><br>
    By 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.</i></p><br><br>
    
    <p  class="p2"><i><h4>Bronze Age</h4><br>
    Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.</i></p><br><br>
    
    <p  class="p2"><i><h4>Iron Age Edom</h4><br><br>
    The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites.<br>
     This made Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood.<br>
    
    Initially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were<br>
     thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.<br>
    
    The Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II)</i></p><br><br>
    
          <p   class="p2"><i><h4>Emergence of Petra</h4><br>
            The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture<br>
             and water.[9] Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars.<br>
              Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[22] Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean<br>
               name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.<br><br>
            
            The Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by<br>
             five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, "ranks highest in the land of the Arabs" and was still called Rekeme<br>
              by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).[23] The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra.[24] Arabic raqama<br> 
              means "to mark, to decorate", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff <br>
              at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).<br><br>
            
            
            An old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela,<br>
             would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means "rock" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the<br>
              book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.<br><br>
            
            The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some<br>
             light upon the history of Petra, but the "petra" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there<br>
              was no town in existence there at the time.</i></p><br><br>
