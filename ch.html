    <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(250, 246, 246);"><i>Christ the Redeemer, colossal statue of Jesus Christ at the summit of Mount Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil.
         Celebrated in traditional and popular songs, Corcovado towers over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s principal port city. The statue of Christ the Redeemer was completed in 1931
          and stands 98 feet (30 metres) tall, its horizontally outstretched arms spanning 92 feet (28 metres). The statue has become emblematic of both the city of Rio de Janeiro
           and the whole nation of Brazil</i></p><br><br>
           
         <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(245, 237, 237);"><i>The statue, made of reinforced concrete clad in a mosaic of thousands of triangular soapstone tiles, sits on a square 
            stone pedestal base about 26 feet (8 metres) high, which itself is situated on a deck atop the mountain’s summit. The statue is the largest Art Deco-style sculpture in the world.</i></p><br><br>
         
    
                     
                      <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(241, 240, 240);"><i>In the 1850s the Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado
                         to honour Isabel, princess regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, although the project was never approved. In 1921 the Roman Catholic archdiocese
                          of Rio de Janeiro proposed that a statue of Christ be built on the 2,310-foot (704-metre) summit, which, because of its commanding height, would make it visible
                           from anywhere in Rio. Citizens petitioned Pres. Epitácio Pessoa to allow the construction of the statue on Mount Corcovado.

                         <p class="p2"  style="color: rgb(241, 238, 238);"><i>Permission was granted, and the foundation stone of the base was ceremonially laid on April 4, 1922—to commemorate
                             the centennial on that day of Brazil’s independence from Portugal—although the monument’s final design had not yet been chosen. That same year a competition was 
                             held to find a designer, and the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa was chosen on the basis of his sketches of a figure of Christ holding a cross in his right 
                             hand and the world in his left. In collaboration with Brazilian artist Carlos Oswald, Silva Costa later amended the plan; Oswald has been credited with the idea for
                              the figure’s standing pose with arms spread wide. The French sculptor Paul Landowski, who collaborated with Silva Costa on the final design, has been credited as 
                              the primary designer of the figure’s head and hands. Funds were raised privately, principally by the church. Under Silva Costa’s supervision, construction began
                               in 1926 and continued for five years. During that time materials and workers were transported to the summit via railway </i></p><br><br>
