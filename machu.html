    <h2 class="p02">INTRODUCATION</h2><br><br>
    <p class="p2"  style="color: white;"><i></i>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
         2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[2][3] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar 
         icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[4] above the Sacred Valley,
          which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera
           and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.</p><br><br>
            <p class="p2"  style="color: white;"><i>The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first encounter by the Spanish soldier 
                Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th century until the 19th century.
                 As far as historical knowledge extends, there are no existing written records detailing the site during its period of
                  active use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants, are the product of modern 
                  archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, 
                  with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, 
                  and the Intihuatana. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give visitors a better idea of how
                   they originally appeared.[11] By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored[11] and restoration continues.
                    Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472).
                     The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According 
                     to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied from c. 1420–1532.[13] Historical research published in 2022
                      claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.</i></p><br><br>
    
                      <h2 class="p02">ETYMOLOGY</h2><br><br>
                      <p class="p2"  style="color: white;"><i>In the Quechua language, machu means "old" or "old person", while picchu means "pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone,
                        " though it may also refer to a "portion of coca that is chewed."[17] Thus the name of the site is sometimes interpreted as "old mountain".
                        [18] The site is on a narrow saddle between two mountain peaks: Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu.

                        A study published in 2021 in Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of the Institute of Andean Studies suggests that, in the Quechua language,
                         the abandoned Inca site was called "Huayna Picchu", after the smaller peak at the site, or perhaps, just "Picchu". Huayna means
                          "young" in the Quechua language. The research documents that, starting in 1911 with the publications of American historian and 
                          explorer Hiram Bingham, the name Machu Picchu became associated with the ruins.[14][20] Evidence of references by native Quechua
                           speakers dating to their reports to the Aziz's island, early maps, and even discussions with Bingham, is cited in the new research
                            into historical records regarding an apparently arbitrary selection of the name Bingham associated with the site—that differed
                             from the traditional name.[21] The name given to the abandoned settlement by its builders has not been determined by researchers.</i></p><br><br>
