  <li style= "text-align:center;color:rgb(15, 15, 15);font-style:inherit;font-size: 20px; text-underline-position: below; "> <i>1.The total length of the Great Wall is 21196.18 km</i></li><br>

      1.Petra was named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World by UNESCO in 2007. 
      The organization described<br> the historic site as “one of the most precious cultural properties of man’s cultural heritage.”<br><br>
      2.Petra also goes by the name the “Red Rose City.” This name stems from the<br> pink color of the stone that the Nabateans carved to build the city. <br><br>
      3.“The Lost City” is another popular name Petra goes by. The Western world had no<br>
       knowledge of Petra’s existence until 1812. In fact, no European had entered the ancient site since the Crusades before that year.<br><br>
      4.The Western world “rediscovered” Petra thanks to Johann Ludwig Burckhardt,<br> a Swiss explorer who traveled to Petra in 1812. <br><br>
      5.Petra has been a popular film location in Jordan – and is iconic around the world.<br>
       The Mummy Returns and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade both had their crews shoot a few scenes at Petra.<br><br></i></p>
     

      <p  class="p2"><i>
      6.Petra is one of the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists believe the Nabateans established the city in 312 BC.<br><br>
      7.It was the capital city of Nabateans, an ancient Arab tribe who inhabited northern <br>
      Arabia and the southern Levant and arrived in Jordan around the 6th century BC.<br><br>
      8.The Nabateans didn’t call it Petra. According to the ancient historian Josephus, evidence <br>
      suggests the Nabatean knew Petra as Raqemo, the Aramaic name of its royal founder. <br><br> 
      9.Archaeologists have explored only 15% of Petra. I think this is one of the most <br>
      surprising and exciting facts about Petra. Most of the city remains underground, but it only means that there are more wonders to come!<br><br>
      10.Petra was home to three different peoples throughout history: the Edomites inhabited<br>
       Petra from 18th to the 2nd century BC; the Nabateans from 2nd century to 106 BC; and the Romans from 106 to 395 BC. <br><br>
