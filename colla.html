        The Colosseum  is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre
         ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir,
          Titus . Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian.[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the
           Flavian Amphitheatre Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio  by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).</i></p><br><br>
            <p   class="p2"><i>
                The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average
                 audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock
                  sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</i></p><br><br>
            <p class="p2" ><i>
                Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of<br>
                 Rome's most popular tourist attractions and has links to the Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The <br>
                 Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the 5 euro cent coin.</i></p><br><br>
