                <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(228, 221, 221);"><i><h3>1. MACHU PICCHU ISN’T THAT OLD</h3>
                    Scholars believe that the Incas started constructing Machu Picchu around 1450 AD under Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui
                     who ruled the Inca Empire from 1438 to 1471. This is a full millennium after the fall of the Roman Empire and 
                     less than a century before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Peru.</i></p><br><br>
                      
                   
                     
                      
                 
                      <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(243, 240, 240);"><i><h3>2. THE INCAS DIDN’T USE ANY MORTAR IN ITS CONSTRUCTION</h3>
                        The Incas were adept engineers and were able to build the entire citadel of Machu Picchu without using any mortar.
                         Instead, they used a special technique called ashlar, which involves cutting stones so precisely that they lay on 
                         top of one another without any space between them. You wouldn’t even be able to slide a sheet of paper through the stones!
                        
                        </i></p><br>
                          <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(245, 236, 236);"><i><h3>3. MACHU PICCHU IS EARTHQUAKE-PROOF</h3>
                            Here is where that last Machu Picchu fact becomes even more interesting! In general, Peru has high seismic activity, 
                            and Machu Picchu itself is located near two fault lines. Knowing this, the Incas used various techniques to make their 
                            buildings resistant to earthquakes. These included the ashlar technique mentioned above, as well as trapezoidal-shaped
                             doors and windows, inward inclining walls, and bracing blocks. </i></p><br>

                           <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(238, 234, 234);"><i><h3>4. MACHU PICCHU WAS NEVER “LOST”</h3>
                            The explorer Hiram Bingham III brought the ruins of Machu Picchu international recognition and titled his account of the
                             exploration The Lost City of the Incas. However, the site was never truly “lost.” Many locals in the region knew it was there.
                              In fact, a local innkeeper Melchor Arteaga guided Bingham to the site. Moreover, there were Quechua farmers who were still
                               cultivating the terraces when Bingham showed up in 1911.</i></p><br>
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(231, 223, 223);"><i><h3>5. SCHOLARS AREN’T COMPLETELY SURE WHAT THE INCAS USED MACHU PICCHU FOR</h3>
                                The Incas didn’t have a writing system, so there are no written records of the people who lived there. Most archaeologists
                                 believe that the emperor Pachacuti had it built as a royal estate. However, some believe it was a retreat for high ranking 
                                 religious leaders and scholars of the Inca empire.

                              <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(243, 241, 241);"><i><h3>6. MACHU PICCHU MEANS “OLD MOUNTAIN”</h3>
                                Although the conquistadors introduced the Spanish language in the 16th century, many Andean people in Peru still speak a 
                                local language called Quechua. Quechua is the source for many place names throughout the country. Machu is Quechua for 
                                “old” or “old person.” Picchu refers to a conical-shaped solid structure and, in this case, interpreted as “mountain.”</i></p><br>
                            
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(245, 236, 236);"><i><h3>7. THERE WAS A 100 YEAR-LONG DISPUTE BETWEEN PERU AND YALE OVER ARTIFACTS COLLECTED FROM MACHU PICCHU</h3>
                                Hiram Bingham’s team collected thousands of artifacts from the ruins and sent them to Yale University during the scientific excavation of the site from 
                                1912 to 1915. These artifacts included ceramics, jewelry, silver pieces, and human bones. The Peruvian government contested that the artifacts should be
                                 returned for years until Yale finally sent them back in 2012.</i></p><br><br>
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(240, 234, 234);"><i><h3>8. SOME BELIEVE THAT ALIENS BUILT MACHU PICCHU</h3>
                                There are some amateur scholars that believe aliens built Machu Picchu. For them, it seems inconceivable that a people without iron tools,
                                 draft animals, or even the wheel could have lugged such large stones up the mountainside and built such magnificent structures. However, archeologists
                                  and scholars agree that the Incas, with their impressive engineering techniques and use of human labor, were more than capable of constructing the site
                                   without outside (or outer-worldly) help.</i></p><br>
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(247, 246, 246);"><i><h3>9. MACHU PICCHU IS AT A LOWER ALTITUDE THAN CUSCO</h3>
                                Many travelers worry about the effects of altitude sickness when traveling to Machu Picchu, but the site is actually at a lower altitude than Cusco. 
                                Machu Picchu sits at 7,970 feet (2,430 meters) while Cusco is located at 11,200 feet (3,400 meters). The threshold for altitude sickness symptoms is 
                                about 8,000 feet (2,500 meters). Unfortunately, you can’t just go directly to Machu Picchu since all transportation and trekking tours start in Cusco.</i></p><br>

                              <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(235, 232, 232);"><i><h3>10. MACHU PICCHU IS LOCATED IN A CLOUD FOREST</h3>
                                Because of its location on the edge of the Andes and the Amazon rainforest, Machu Picchu has a very unique climate. In contrast to Cusco’s relatively dry 
                                weather and barefaced mountains, Machu Picchu is lush and green and often encompassed by low hanging clouds and mist. You can even see a wide variety of 
                                subtropical species of brightly colored birds and flowers.
