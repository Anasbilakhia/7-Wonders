                  The Great Pyramid looks like a grassy hill by a church. The church on the hill is Nuestra Señora de los Remedios (Rectoral parish of Our Lady of Remedies.) Once you discover the unreconstructed pyramid next to it, you see the original geometric outline of the original structure with four levels. </i></p><br><br>
                      
                   
                     
                      
                 
                      <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(243, 240, 240);"><i><h3>2. It’s Hidden Under a Mountain </h3>
                        The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is the most famous pyramid in the world, but it isn’t the biggest. 
                        The Great Pyramid of Cholula holds that title. It’s four times larger than Giza and twice its volume.<br>

                        The reason why it’s commonly overlooked is because the gigantic pyramid is hidden under layers of dirt. 
                        People usually see it more as a hill than a place of worship. <br>
                        
                        </i></p><br>
                          <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(245, 236, 236);"><i><h3>3. It Contains 7 Pyramids </h3>
                            Excavations discovered the original colors of the bricks and how they called the first pyramid La Conejera (Building A). 
                            The pyramid’s second phase was the Pyramid of the Pointed Skulls on top of La Conejera, and it had seven levels that led
                             to the Altar of the Sculpted Skulls. The Pyramid of the Nine Stories, which was the largest part of the construction,
                              had nine floors and the Altar del Jaguar (Jaguar Altar.)  </i></p><br>

                           <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(238, 234, 234);"><i><h3>4. It was Built by the Toltecs </h3>
                            The Toltecs built the first pyramid of Cholula. The structure is similar to the nearby Teotihuacán with the Toltec Pyramid
                             of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. <br>

Each indigenous group added their own contribution to their pyramids. Cholula was the center of worship for Quetzalcoatl, one of the Mayans’ most important gods.
 When the Aztecs eventually arrived, they were amazed by Cholula’s size. They believed the mythological giant Xelhua must have built it.</i></p><br>
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(231, 223, 223);"><i><h3>5. It was a Religious Temple </h3>
                              Indigenous death rituals took place in the center of the pyramid. Most Mesoamerican pyramids primarily served as altars for 
                              religious ceremonies—including human sacrifice. Instead of keeping their rituals a secret, ancient Mesoamerican priests 
                              conducted them in public to demonstrate their power.  
                            </i></p><br>

                              <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(243, 241, 241);"><i><h3>6. Cholula is a Nahuatl Word</h3>
                                The word Cholula is a Nahuatl word meaning the place of retreat. There’s even a famous hot sauce in Mexico called Cholula.
                                 When you’re there, be sure to learn more words in Nahuatl and to try this famous Mexican hot sauce!</i></p><br>
                            
                            
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(245, 236, 236);"><i><h3>7. It’s Covered in Vegetation  </h3>
                              During the power shifts from indigenous groups to the Spanish conquerors, Cholula lost a lot of people. The Toltec-Chichimeca
                               built new pyramid temples close to the Great Pyramid of Cholula. <br>

The adobe bricks that the Toltecs used for the Great Pyramid didn’t hold up well due to the humid climate. The bricks also made it a fertile ground for 
vegetation to take over. The pyramid was majestic and became indistinguishable after Mother Nature took over.  </i></p><br><br>
                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(240, 234, 234);"><i><h3>8. It’s a Burial Ground </h3>
                              Over 400 human burials were uncovered during excavations of the Great Pyramid. These burials are from the postclassic period; 
                              they were human sacrifices during the Toltec’s rituals. Cholula was the second most popular city in its glory. But the conquerors 
                              forced the indigenous tribes out of their home in Cholula.

                             <p  class="p2" style="color: rgb(247, 246, 246);"><i><h3>9. They Knew the Conquerors were Coming</h3>
                              According to legend, the Toltecs knew that the Spanish conquerors were coming. The locals decided to cover the precious temple
                               with soil so that they couldn’t find it. <br>

                              To build the pyramid, the outer bricks were smoothed. When it was in its prime, their temple was covered in yellow, red, and black insects. <br>
                              
                              Nearly 500 years after the colonial conquest, the ruins can be explored through tunnels. The site is full of tourists curious to see the
                               largest pyramid in the world.

                                The conquistadors, led by Hernán Cortés, decided to build a church on top of the Great Pyramid, not knowing what was beneath it. 
                                Experts believe that Cholula had 365 churches, one for each day of the year and matches to the 365 temples. <br>

                                Fewer churches are there today, and the most visible one is on top of it. A multi-domed cathedral was built in 1594.
