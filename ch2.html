               <h3 style="color: rgb(243, 240, 240);">1. It was a Brazilian/French collaboration</h3>
               <p  class="p2" style="color: white;"><i>The Roman Catholic archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro commissioned the statue. Polish-French sculptor Paul 
                    Landowski created the statue. Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa built the statue in collaboration
                     with the French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian artist Gheorghe Leonida created the statue’s face. The original
                      sketch was of Christ carrying a large cross in one hand and a globe in the other. The statue earned the
                       nickname ‘Christ with a ball’. In the end, after surveying the land, a design was decided upon of Christ
                        with his arms wide open in an Art Deco style.

                                 from the train station to reach the statue. However, in 2003, officials installed a series of escalators and elevators to make the journey easier.
